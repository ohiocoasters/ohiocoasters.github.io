<txt class="heading">About Ohio Coasters:</txt>
<br>
<br>
<txt class="bodytxt"> Ohio Coasters is an amusement park media blog focused on photography and Ohio's amusement industry; past and present. Ohio Coasters was created in May of 2018 as a way for me to share pictues I took at Cedar Point. As I became more invested in the coaster community I stared to think about what I could do to be a part of this. Since the page started, it has been mainly a photography page, however, over the past couple of weeks I have worked on bringing new things to Ohio Coasters. The first thing was the launch of this website on April 13th, and we will be following that up with the re-launching of our blog and photo gallery. Finally, within the coming weeks we hope to finish securing some deals and launch our store which will include photo prints and exclusive vintage amusement appareal. Thank you for taking your tie to check our site out!

    Ride On,
