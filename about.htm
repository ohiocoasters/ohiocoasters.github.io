  <h1>About Us</h1>

  <div> 
    <h3> About Us: Well, more like, about me. My name is Nick, I am a High School student in Northeast Ohio as well as the owner/ceo/head honcho of this operation. 
      In 2017, I started getting into roller coaster enthusiast culture and wanted to be a part of it. Another thing
      that I wanted was to be able to show my creative talents. I've always had a want to photograph, write, tell stories 
      and share my experiences with others. So, I created an instagram page. It went through many different names and iterations 
      until I finally landed on Ohio Coasters. I felt it was not to uncommon, but it wasnt taken yet so I made it mine. I posted
      on Instagram and Facebook, as well as created my website. My website is my real true love of the three becuase 
      I developed and coded it myself. As of recent (Arpil 21') I changed the name from Ohio Coasters Amusement Park Photograph to 
      Ohio Coasters Amusement Park Media to further and more accuratly embody my goals and what I do.
